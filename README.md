# Harmonious Collaboration: A FHE-based Music Composition Game ðŸŽ¶

Harmonious Collaboration is an innovative music composition game that empowers multiple players to collaboratively create unique musical pieces using **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. By leveraging this cutting-edge technology, players can contribute individual musical elements while keeping their creative inputs confidential and secure, ultimately culminating in a harmonious and collaborative musical experience.

## The Creative Challenge

In today's world, musical collaboration often faces barriers such as intellectual property concerns and the risk of revealing unique ideas before they can be properly shared. Artists want to collaborate, but they also desire privacy and protection of their original contributions. This project addresses these challenges by allowing musicians to work together on compositions without compromising their individual input or ideas.

## The FHE Solution

The power of **Fully Homomorphic Encryption**, made possible through Zama's open-source libraries, allows players to encrypt their musical contributions while still enabling others to hear and build upon them. This means that musicians can collaborate in a secure environment where their individual ideas remain hidden until the final product is decrypted. The use of Zama's tools, such as the **Concrete SDK**, enables seamless integration of encryption into the collaborative process, making it both efficient and user-friendly.

## Core Features

- **Encrypted Musical Contributions**: Each player's music component (melodies, harmonies) is securely encrypted, allowing collaborations while maintaining privacy.
- **Collaborative Environment**: Users can listen to encrypted components from others to inspire their creative process, fostering a unique collaborative experience.
- **Asynchronous Creation**: Musicians can work on different parts of a composition at various times, making it easy to adapt and refine musical pieces.
- **Final Decryption**: Once collaboration concludes, a seamless process to decrypt the final composition reveals the rich blend of contributions made by all players.
- **Multitrack Sequencer and Collaboration Space**: A visually engaging environment where users can interact with each other's contributions and experiment with musical ideas.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK**: Utilizing Zama's libraries for Fully Homomorphic Encryption.
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software.
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Web Audio API**: For processing and playing audio data in the browser.
